# Approov QuickStart - Google Cloud API Gateway for Cloud Run

[Approov](https://approov.io) is an API security solution used to verify that requests received by your API services originate from trusted versions of your mobile apps.

This repo implements the Approov API request verification on a [Google API Gateway for Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway/docs/get-started-cloud-run), which performs the verification check on the Approov Token before allowing valid traffic to reach the API endpoint.
